# CS_410_RUST_Final
An XML parser to generate a game GUI:


# Overview:
In short, this repository is an attempt to develop a library capabile of sepperating a game GUI from the actual game display. In many modern game engines this is a standard approach. 

XML files contain button implementation details and settings. Each time a program is reloaded (or a command manually triggered), the XML file is reparsed and the buttons, healthbars, menus are reinstantiated (Allowing for dynamic configuration).
